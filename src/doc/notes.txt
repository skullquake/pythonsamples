try powershell core
	cross platform
	not profiles
	there is a built in one
	there is a portable/sererate one
		powershell 6???

rg
	ripgrep
	pkg install ripgrep
	sample usage
		rg print
		will search all files for print
		highlighted

fd
	search files
	e.g.
		fd py
		lists all .py files

bat
	like cat with syntax highlighting
	very nice output

fzf
	fuzzy finder
	better than find
	pkg install fzf
	sample usage
		vim $(fzf)
		this will help with search/open

wsl as substitute for msys/cygwin
	has package manager
	might run faster
	enable
		gui or cli
			windows features
			windows subsystem for linux
	run
		browser: windows app store ubuntu
		there might also be a powershell script for this
	sudo apt-get update&&sudo apt-get upgrade
	research
		x11 server for wsl

winpython
	portable monolithic

spyder
	ide
	takes long to start
pycharm
	intelij
	might have commercial aspect
most ides use ipython
vscode
	install python extension
	setup posershell for console/setup wsl for console
	has vim extension
ipython
	a more friendly interpreter
jupyter notebook
	interactive
	browser
	charts and data
	you can create notebooks
		these can be used for learning materials as well
vim set color
	:colorscheme industry
python
	module is a dictionary
	dir lists the dictionary
		import math;
		print(dir(math));
investigate cmath
	this is for complex math
	print(3j)
	this also relates to coordinates
		geographical programming
the # comment in python

importing
	this actually imports a file
	remember to not name your file
	the same as the thing your are importing
		turtle.py
			import turtle

	the second and third lines
	are not just comments
	research this
	you can set up vimrc to use python documentation 
	research how to accomplish this

pydoc3
	python3 -m pydoc
	or
	pydoc
	this is command line version of
	the help() function from the repl
		e.g.

		pydoc a

single quotes/double quotes
	there is not difference in the interpretation
	e.g. \ in a double or single quote is the same thing

type
	help(type)
	type is also a type
repr
	representation
	print(repr(0)
	print(repr(str(0))
	you can overload repr for a class to provide your own string repr
lists and tuples
	lists and tuples are differentiated on mutability
	main thing to do is iterate over elements of elements
sequence
	the same concept as a colleciton
list
	elements can be of any typea
chr
	there is no chr type, just str
style guid
	dont write wider than 72 characters
list slicing
	[start:end:step]
	end is not included
		[0:4:1]
			0,1,2,3,
	you can also use negative indexes
		[-8:-16:-2]
	there are many experiments you can do with lists and strings to test this
	e.g.
		#reverse
		a="0123456789abcdef";
		print(a[len(a)::-1)
		leaving out second make inclusive
		#reverse alt
		a="0123456789abcdef";
		print(a[::-1)
		leaving out second make inclusive
references
	a=[0]
	b=a
	a.append(1)

	a=[]
	b=a[:]
	a.push(0)
	print(a)#neq b
	print(b)#neq a
list tuple concatenation
	different types
	so
		list((0,1,2,3))+[]
		tuple([0,1,2,3])+()
take note of the main pattern

pep 8
	style guide for python code
	follow this standard
	there is a tool that can help you
		black
			pip install black
			formatting quality
		or
		flake8
			pip install flake8
			invocation
			python -m flake8 file.py
	and
		pylint
			code quality
			shows if there is not documentation
			you can set up vim to run pylint automatically
	note the output of these programs and learn the style convensions
	style convensions are important in the python world
	global varialbes are supposed to be UPPERCASE
membership
	in is an operator
	a="qwer"
	"q" in a#true
	b=[0,1,2,3]
	0 in b#true
any iterable can be converted to a list or tuple
	list("qwer")
	tuple("qwer")
del
	del is a statement that deletes objects for example from a dictionary
manipulation lists
	a=[0,1,2,3]
	a[:2]=[3,2]
	a=[0,1,2,3]
	a[2:]=[1,0]
	because sliced lhs, its a reference to the subarray
element insertion
	a=list("qwer");
	a[0:0]="X"
	# delete every second
	a=list("0123456789")
	del a[0::2]
	#reverse od
	a=list("01234567890")
	a[::2]=a[::-2]
research
	angled brackets in python documentation referring to class vs referring to object
append
	append pushes an item onto a list
	pop and append goes together
	pop takes away the last element and returns
emptying a list
	clear(somelist)
counting in lists
	print(list("qwer").count("q"))
	print([[1,2],[3,4]].count([1,2]))
take note of all the list operations

pip install local
	pip install --user asdf
	the stuff will be installed to ~/.local/bin
	you have to add this to the path

everything in python is in a dictionary and nested dictionary
	scope and inheritance is implemented with nested dictionaries
	when we talk about a function, it is an entry in an dictionary
	that points to data/code

duck typing
	type is based on qualities of thing???

built in functions
	functions that are built into the language

keywords
	import keyword
	print(keyword.kwlist)
builtins
	import builtins
	print(dir(builtins))
reflection
	die idee dat 'n taal homself kan ontleed

you can actually name things the names of keywords and builtins

repr()
	converts to string
	0.toString()
	repr(0)
numeric to base
	bin(0)
	oct(0)
	hex(0)
pow operator
	**
	e.g.
	2**2
utf-8 is a variable length encoding
	this makes adding numbers to glyphs difficult
	ascii is a subset of utf-8
	so ascii text does not have to be converted to utf-8

	"change code page"
	chcp
	how to change it
	chcp 65001
pip multiline
a=(
	"asdf"
	"qwer"
	"zxcv"
)
triple quoted strings
	downside is indentiation, indentation whitespace is included in the value
	the above is an alternative
there is a section in the course notes of dealing with this
also note the escape sequences
formatted strings
	python >=3.6
	a="foo";
	print(f"a: {a}");
	compare that with javascript string literals
	print(f"a:{('_'*8)}")
ord
	ord("asdf")
	ord("a")
	ordinal value of first char
chr
	opposite of ord
	e.g. print(chr(ord("a"))#a
print function
	print("a","b","c")#space seperator
	print("a","b","c",sep="---")#--- seperator
	print("a","b","c",sep="---",end="_")#--- seperator, _ end
	avoid newline at end???
	print("a","b","c",end="")#avoid newline
determine type
	use is operator
	type(0) is int
read up on hackintosh
truthiness
	truth is nebulous
	values are handled as true or false
	e.g.
		if 10:
			print('a');
		if object :
			print('a');
boolean specifics
	user=user or 'anon'
	the truthy value can actually be something else, not necessarily
	a reall boolean
	ensuring functions returned true and executing them from left to right only if all returned true
		f0() and f1() and f2()
if number is too big, its value exceeds 64 bits
	it will be stored in an arbitrary precision type
use double quotes
	because black makes it all double quotes in any ways

you can set up a configure file for pylint
	research this
python vim module
	vim autoformat for python

dict
	keys can be any immutable type, numeric, string, float, tuple
	you can create a dict with dict()
	you can have strange combintations
	e.g.
	{tuple([]):0}
	{tuple([]):0,tuple([0]):1}
	dictionaries also have operations
dict itr
	for k in myDict:
		print(f"{k},{myDict[k]}");
	for k,v in myDict:
		print(f"{k},{v}");
	see also how to get iterables
lists are faster than dict
you can create an html template with dictionaries
getting values
	{'a':'b'}.get('a')
	{'a':'b'}.get('b')
	{'a':'b'}.get('b','default')
	a['a']
	a['b']
how to get iterables
	a={'a':'a','b':'b'};
	for b in a.items():
		print(b);
how to get the keys
	a={'a':'b','c':'d'};
	for b in a.keys():
		print(a[b])
how to get the values
	a={'a':'b','c':'d'};
	for b in a.values():
		print(b)
you can push and pop on dict
	pop needs a key
setdefault is like get
	but a get if not exists set
	if the key does not exists it operates to create it
	else it works just like get
dict update
	this is like merging dictionaries
print
	there is a way to print to a file

importing
	from flask import Flask
	for example
	lazy (this is frowned upon)
		from flask import *
		there is a way of writing a module that prohibits this

tuples without parentheses
	1,2
	(1,2)
	a,b=1,2
	(a,b)=1,2
	a,b=(1,2)
	(a,b)=(1,2)
swapping
	a,b=1,2
	a,b=b,a
chained assignment
	a=b=c=0
	a,b,c=d,e,f=0,1,2
* in lhs tuple assignment
	a,b,*c=1,2,3,4
	a,*b,c=1,2,3,4
	*a,b,c=d,*e,f=g,h,*i=1,2,3,4

	you cannot have to * names in the tpl
try download python for dos
	2.4.2
True and mathematica operators
	True+True # 2
if statements
	if boolean:
		...
	if boolean:
		...
	else:
		...
ternary operator:
	a=0 if boolean else 1;
	this is similar to the conditional operator in c/cpp
  other exc
	  print(0) if true else print(1) if True else print(3)
		compare with
		true?print(0):true?print(1):print(2);

elif
	this is similar to shell scripting
		if a:
			...
		elif b:
			...
		elif c:
			...
if blocks
	you can define a function in a block
		if True:
			def a():
				print('b');
		else:
			def a():
				print('b');
		this might be good for doing version checking os checking
the reason that capital letters have a bigger numerical value is due to the development
at a point there was only capital letters
boolean operators
	and
	or
	not
	...and not && | !
testing in range
	if 1<=n and n<=10:
	special case
		if 1<=n<=10:
			...uniquely pythonic
assertions
	this is about design time
	if there are more asserts then it indicates that it has design
	for example
		import os
		assert(os.path.isfile('/path/to/file'));
	with a message
		import os
		assert(os.path.isfile('/path/to/file')),'msg';
	with a message
	let the program crash with an assert
	you can raise it as follows with a message
		if asdf:
			raise AssertionError('msg');
range based loops:
	instead of using a while loop
		a=0;
		while a<8;
			print(a);
			a=a+1;
	you can use range based loops
		for i in range(8):
			print(i);
		for i in range(0,8):
			print(i);
		for i in range(0,8,1):
			print(i);
		for i in range(8,0,-1):
			print(i);
	range is a class
	it is an iterable
	it is a generator, so it calculates, it does not create the actual
	list, this is lighter on the hardware
	it expects integer values
opamps gates
	read up on that
stl range in cpp
	cpp20 will have range similar to this
enumerate
	this returns a list of tuples with idx and val
	e.g.
	enumerate(['a','b','c'])
	usage
		list(enumerate(['a','b'])) # a tuple (0,'a')
		for a,b in enumerate(l):
			print(a,b)
iterating dictionaries
	d={'a','b'}
	for a in d:
		print(a);
	for a list(d):
		print(a);
	for a d.keys():
		print(a);
items
	{}.items() returns tuples of pairs
zip
	combine lists
		zip([0,1],[2,3])
		list(zip([0,1],[2,3]))
		print(dict(zip(range(0,8,1),range(8,0,-1))))
join
	'seperator'.join(stringOrList)
	','.join('ab')
	','.join(['a','b'])
for and while else clauses
	for and while loops can have else clauses
		if a loop has no break statement, then at the end
		the else will execute or something like that

how to upgrade pip
				python -m pip install pip --upgrade
				you can manipulate pip config in pip.conf
				you can also have a pip.conf in the venv for the local pip
				to duplicate a venv and ensure it remains the same
								pip freeze > requirements.txt
								create new env
								activate
								copy requirements.txt
								pip install -r requirements.txt
[un]installing with pip and upgrading
				pip install flask
				pip flask --upgrade
				pip uninstall flask
pip list packages
				pip list
								list installed packages
				pip search
virtual environments
				you can use virtualenv which is older
				or you can use venv which is newer
								python -m venv
								this came out around python 3.3
venv
				python -m venv --prompt MYPY mypy
whl
				this is an old thing
other environment tools
				pipenv
				pyenv
								this allows you to install specific versions
								of python
				research this
pypi
				pypi.org
				this is where pip searches for modules
				if something is on pypi its installable and
				has documentation
flatpak
				making things portable
				this is like protable app or osx app folder thingy
				e.g.
								you can install visual studio code as a flatpak
								just as an example
				research this
comprehensions
				its an abstract shorter way to create lists
				its a syntax to create a list
				#create list ints
				[a for a in range(8)]
				#you can use comprehensions in comprehensions
				[b for b in [a for a in range(8)a]]
				#create list of lists
				[[b] for b in [a for a in range(8)a]]
				#create list of tuples
				[(b,) for b in [a for a in range(8)a]]
				print([(b,b**b) for b in [a for a in range(8)a]]);
								equiv
												a=[];
												for b in range(8):
																a.append((b,b**b));
												print(a);
				#figure out what this does
								[[a for c in range(8)] for a in range(8)]
								this seems to create a 2d array
vim
				practice using .
memoization
				cache expensive calculations
comprehensions nested loops
				[(a,b) for a in [0,1] for b in [2,3]]
markdown
				commonmark java impl
				pandoc does that as well
vim modules
				vimbal
								this is old
				pathogen
								a module manager
								unzip
								deploy
								modify .vimrc
				vundel
								this can get stuff from github
tmux customizations and plugins
modifying the statusline in vim
iosefka font
				you can compile and modify this
				this is not build with svg its built using a languagse
generator:
				for b in (a**a for a in range(8)):
								print(b);
				(a**a for a in range(8))
								this is a generator
								it creates elements on the fly
								the difference is () vs [] that encloses it all
exec and eval
				eval executes and returns value
				exec executes and returns nothing
				you can create a scope and give it to eval or exec as its scope
								a={}
								eval('0',a);
								exec('print(0)',a);
								a={'b':'c'};
								exec('print(b);');
callable
				def a():
								return;
				type(a);#function
				callable(a);#function
				if no return is specified it will return none, e.g.
								def a():
												...
				return is actually an unnamed variable
positional parameters
				def a(b,c):
								print(b);
								print(c);
								return;
				#positional call
				a('a','b');
				#kwargs 
				a(a='a',b='b');
				a(b='b',a='a');

								luatex ...
python function scope
				the function upon call has its own dictionary
passing lists or dictionaries as parameter
				pass by reference trick
function pass by reference
				you have to use a hack
				a=[8];
				def b(c):
								c[0]=c[0]++;
				print(a);
				b(a);
				print(a);
				#you can also do it with a dictionary
read up on 
				default values for parameters
				required parameters
collecting parameters
				def a(*b):
								print(b);
								print(type(b));
				b will be a tuple
				you can write flexible functions with this
				if a function in the api is defined as foo(*bar) then it 
				refers to collecting parameters
								print(b);
				a(1,2,3);
collecting parameters and normal params
				def a(b,*c):
								print(b);
								print(c);
				a(1,2,3);#1 will go into b, 2,3 will go into c
collecting arguments
				def a(b,c,d):
								print(a);
								print(b);
								print(c);
								return;
				b={'b':'b','c':'c','d','d'};
				a(**b);
				or
				a({'b':'b','c':'c','d','d'});
** arg
				#kwarg par
				def a(**b):
								print(b);
				a(b=0,c=1,d=2);
				#will print dict
vars
				vars is a global function
				shows variables
				e.g.
				a=0;
				print(vars()['a']);
is this useful
				import module if not already imported
				exec('import random') if not vars().get('random') else None;
scope
				python implements scope with dictionaries
send scope to fn
				def a(b):
								b['a']=1;
								return;
				a=0;
				print(a);
				a(vars());
				print(a);
fn decl glob var
				#talk out
				def a():
								global b;
								b=0;
				type(b);
				a();
				type(b);
				print(b);
shadowing
				local variable supercedes same named variable from higher scope
globals
				globals() function returns dictionary of global variables
				you can manipulate this
				compare with vars()
				run this in a function to see how it behaves
function
				creating a name with a callable value
nesting functions
				def a():
								def b():
												return;
								return;
returning a function
				# this returns a function pointer
				def a():
								def b():
												return;
								return a;
				# call
				a()()
putting functions in dict
				def a():
								def b():
												return;
								def c():
												return;
								return {"b":b,"c":c};
				a()["a"]()
				a()["b"]()
interesting combination
				def a(b):
								def c(d):
												return b+d;
								return c;
				print(a(1)(2))
				# the above indicates that python engine will realize
				# that the returned function references a scope
				# and that the outer scope should not be destroyed
				# this has to do with closure
				# a closure is when an inner function accesses the outer ones scope
				# python has to capture the scope
				# read up on this
				# you can use this to store variables, play with vars() and stuff
				def a():
								c=0;
								def b(c=vars()):
												c+=1;
												print(c);
												return;
								return b;
				b=a();
				b();
				b();
				b();
recursion
				def a(b):
								print("{}".format(b));
								a(b-1) if b>0 else None;
				there is nothing special about recursion as you can implement
				it using standard things, setting up a stack manually etc
map
				remaps values
								def a(b):
												return b*b;
								list(map(a,[1,2,3]));
filter
				def a(b):
								return b%2==0;
				list(filter(a,range(8)));
lambdas in python
				are not so useful
				it can only have one statement
				you can hack a multiline with exec("""line...""") though
argument parsing library
				argparse
				getopt
vim can be extend
				first check if vim is compiled with python
				vim --version
								check for -lpythonxxx linked in
				read up on ftplugin
								$HOME/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim
								and then you can put stuff in your .vimra
				just google how to write a python plugin for vim
				:echo has('python')
				or
				:echo has('python3')
				airline has a predecessor written in python
				many plugins are in python
				you can set up something like make if you run make
				then it runs pylint and things for you
				python might be a function in vim
				py3 print("a")
								how to get this into the screen
				then there is also a python module for vim
a good website
				https://news.ycombinator.com
unimplemented functions and classes
				use pass
				or raise exception
								raise AssertionError('stub');
another interesting one
				def a():
								return a();
				print(a())
				print(a()())
				print(a()()())
				print(a()()()()...)
				this always goes on to return itself
functions
				def a(*b):
								#b is list???
								...
				def a(**b):
								#b is dict???
								...
function attributes
				def a():
								a.b='c'
								a.d='e'
								print(a.b)
								print(a.d)
				a()
				#to maintain state
				def a():
								if not hasattr(a,'b'):
												a.b=0
								print(a.b)
								a.b+=1;
				#you can also manipulate function attributes from other functions
				def a():
								if not hasattr(a,'b'):
												a.b=0
								print(a.b)
								a.b+=1;
				def reseta():
								a.b=0
function factory
				import random
				def a():
								b[]
								def c():
												print("c")
												return
								def d():
												print("d")
												return
								b.append(c)
								b.append(d)
								b[random.randint(0,len(b)-1)]()
				a()
				a()
				...
you can also pass function
nonlocal
				for inner function in outer function use nonlocal to refer to 
				names in the outer scope
				def a():
								b=0
								def c():
												nonlocal b
												b=1
								c()
								print(b)
				a()
				#compare with
				def a():
								b=0
								def c():
												b=1
								c()
								print(b)
				a()
.vimrc
				line continuation
								\
				check file type
				:set ft ???
				check see its python
				take a look at the python configuration in the .vimrc
								set foldcolumn=1 nofoldenable foldmethod=indent
				use then for folding
								z
								zr
								zm
								zo
								zc
								shift m ???
oop
				python does not really have polymorphism
				you get it for free
								because python searches for a name in a dictionary
								python just does a name lookup
												a.foo
												b.foo
												...
												z.foo
												it does not matter if a,b...z has different types
isinstance of
				isinstance(a,b)
				or
				isinstance([],list)
choice
				import random
				print(random.choice([0,1]))
creating new objects
				a=b()
				# b returns an object
declaring classes
				class a:
								pass
				b=a()
				print(a)
repr and classes
				class a:
								def __str__(self):return "inst a"
								pass
				b=a()
				print(a)
				print(b)
				print(dir(a))
classes and self
				class a:
								def b(self):
												self.c=0
								def d(self):
												self.c+=1
								def e(self):
												print(self.c)
				b=a()
				b.b()
				b.d()
				b.e()
				class a:
								def b(self,c=0):
												self.c=c
												pass
								def d(self):
												print(self.d)
				b=a()
				b.b()
				b.d()
class constructor
				def a:
								def __init__(self,c=0):
												self.c=c
								def ...
example class
				def Person:
								__init__(self,name='',ssoc=''):
												self.name=name
												self.ssoc=ssoc
								def setName(self,name):
												self.name=name
								def setSsoc(self,ssoc):
												self.ssoc=ssoc
								def print(self):
												print("{}:{}".format(self.name,self.ssoc))
				b=Person()
				b.setName('qwer')
				b.setSsoc('1234')
				b.print()
access specifiers
				python has no concept public protected private
				the convention is __
				for example __init__
								the intention is not for you to manually call it
extends
				this is another name for inheritence
keepnote
				research this
				this is a note taking tool
importing classes
				read up on this
.vimrc
				set colorcolumn=84
				how to set the color
				research this

docstrings and sphinx
				python does not have a specification for docstrings
				sphinx can use docstrings
				you can follow the sphinx specification in order to generate documentation
				from the source code
exercise
				compute circle varargs
tmux
				you can also configure
				e.g. set colors
				also google tmux 256 colors
vim colors
				set tco=256
issues with pasting with vim
				look at set paste
arguments parsing pattern
				bool_valid=True
				if args[1:]:
								#perform validation
								#perform possible conversions, e.g. string to int or float
												#also validate
				else:
								#no args
raising exception pattern
				try{
								#...
								raise ValueError("error")
								#...
				except ValueError as ex:
								#handle
finding out how many digits there is in a number
				log(number)
				this can be used for allignment
you can create a class in a class
				you will then access it with a.b.c. ... .z for example
class variables
				class a():
								b=0
								def c(self):
												self.a+=1
								def d(self):
												print(self.b)
				b=a()
				c=a()
				b.c()
				c.c()
				b.d()
				c.d()
inheritance
				class a():pass;
				class b(a):pass;
				class c():pass;
				class d():pass;
				class e(c,d):pass;
is sub class
				issubclass(a,b)
				issubclass(b,a)
				similar to isinstance
callable
				test if name callable
				print(callable(lambda x:x))
annotations and abstract base classes
				a special annotation is used to declare an abstract base class
exceptions
				there is a class with the name exception
				all exceptions inherits from this class
				manual
								a=Exception('qwer')
								raise a
				you can generalize a class from Exception
raise error from none
				read up on this
except else
				try:
								###
				except:
								###
				else:
								#only if no except
except finally:
				used especially for cleanup, close files, close connections
				try:
								###
				except:
								###
				finally:
								#always at end
__getitem__
				subscript overloading
				read up on this
__setitem__
				subscript overloading
				read up on this
subclassing list dict and str
				you can subclass these as well
				you can use this a lot when extending things
properties and getters
				using a.b=c
				instead of a.setB(c)
				there exists decorators for this
				class a():
								def __init__(self):
												pass
								def b(self,c):
												self.d=c
								def e(self):
												return self.d
								f=property(b,e)#this is the important part
				b=a()
				b.d=8
				print(b.d)

returning a tuple
				return (0,1)
				or
				return 0,1 # tuple unpacking, make sure about this
static methods in classes
				if the member function does not have the argument self, then it is
				a static method
				def a():
								def b(self):
												pass
								def c():#static
												pass
				the correct usage is with decorators
				def a():
								def b(self):
												pass
								@staticmethod
								def c():
												pass
								@classmethod
								def d(cls):
												pass
				read up on this
				you can also use decorators on properties
				all that the decorators do is add boilerplate, make sure about this
__getattr__ and __setattr__	 and __delattr__
				read up on this
				you can also override these
								so you can for example override __delattr__ so that users
								cannot delete attributes
yield
				yield works like return
				generate list
								def a():
												yield 0
												yield 1
								print(list(a()))
				a() will return a generator
				yield saves the state
				another example
								def a(b):
												while b>0:
																yield b
																b-=1
								print(list(a(8))
				this is very difficult and needs lots of revision!!!
dir()
				use dir on an object or name to figure out what it does
where does the imports come from
				python searches in sys.path
								import sys
								print(sys.path)
				so you can modify this if you want to distribute you libraries
				in a special way, and you can do this at runtime
				it sill pick the first one it finds
				also look into import overriding
								e.g. loading from a file, or generated code
how to find all the stuff in a module
				import random
				print(random.__all__)
to find the file of a module
				import random
				print(random.__file__)
get platform
				import sys
				print(sys.platform)
the os module
				import os
				print(os.__all__)
				print(os.system('ls'))
				print(os.sep))
				print(os.linesep))
				#there are a lot of useful functions in the os module, investigate it
the fileinput module
				import fileinput
				print(fileinput.__all__)
				investigate this module
				this module seems to take the input arg or args as files
				and operate on them
				this is for writing very short programs because you dont have to 
				parse the arguments and things
writing com
				alternatives g++
				etc
				read up on this
				read up on using this in rust etc
set
				dictionary withou values
				has some things overrided
								+ means union
								intersections
								etc
heaps and deques
				learn this
read up on json parsing
read up on shelve module
				its a type of database
				flat file database
				this is a standard module so you have this without storing stuff
				its a binary file format, .dat
regular expressions
				read up on this
				this is in the re module
other intersting modules
				argparse
				cmd
				csv
				datetime
				difflib
				enum
				functools
				itertools
with vs try
				with open(filename) as f:
								while True:
												char=f.read(1)
												if not char:break
												process(char)
				read up on this
				with open(filename) as f:
								for line in f:
												process(line)
