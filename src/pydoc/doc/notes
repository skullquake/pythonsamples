You can start a pydoc server with the following

pydoc -p 8080

If your files are set up correctly you will see your classes in the list on the web page
in the case of this source tree Person class can be browsed

Generally speaking pydoc is the python documentation tool. In this source folder for example
you can run pydoc Person. You can also search for keywords using the -k flag, although
this takes very long to complete. There is also a small graphical utility, just look in the
man pages.

A useful feature is html documentation generation, which you can use the -w flag for,
for example pydoc -w ./ will generate documentation for files in the current folder
